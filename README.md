### I2C scanner for addresses on devices connected to Arduino


This code scans for the I2C address of the device.

Connect the I2C device's SDA and SCL pins to A4 and A5 pins of the Arduino 

##Device   Arduino

SDA  A4

SCL  A5


Connect the Vcc and the GND pins of the device to Arduino appropriately (5V and GND)
Run the sketch, Open the Serial Monitor and look at the address of the device.

To connect multiple devices, use a breadboard and connect Arduino's A4 and A5.

Connect the Devices SDA and SCL pins to the breadboard, run the program, see the results.
